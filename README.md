# FinOps-Resources
Repository with links and info on how to get started with a career in Cloud FinOps 

My name is Stephanie and I have a background of 8 years in accounting and financial analysis experience. In 2021 I decided to research how I could transition and break into tech. I started with diving into data analysis, then began learning the fundamentals of cloud technology. In August 2022 I passed AZ-900 and shortly after got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn for a Cloud FinOps Analyst role. That is when I first learned of Cloud FinOps and how it would be the perfect opportunity for me to break into the tech industry and still utilize my prior experience. My background in accounting & financial analysis was perfect for giving me transferable skills for this type of role. You do not necessarily need a financial background to work in Cloud FinOps, but it is a great advantage. I created this repository to help anyone who wants to learn more about this space or is interested in pursuing a career in FinOps. Whether you want to work specifically in Cloud FinOps or in any kind of technical role where you will be using or working in the cloud, this information is beneficial for you. 

For the list of resources & information, please see the file "FinOps Repository" in the files section. I am still learning how to use GitHub, so bare with me as I learn and update this page :)
